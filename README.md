<h1 align="center">Hotel Booking and Management System</h1>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">This Java project demonstrates fundamental OOP principles, featuring a structured and user-friendly hotel booking & management system. The application starts with a Login Page, where customers and receptionists can log in. Customers can register, manage bookings, and check billing details, while receptionists handle billing operations.

The project was developed in Eclipse IDE, the GUI was designed using WindowBuilder, following a prototype created in Balsamiq Wireframes for a well-structured interface. To enhance functionality, JAR files like JCalendar (for date selection) and MySQL JDBC Connector (for database connectivity) were integrated, ensuring seamless interaction between the frontend and database.
<pre>
The system follows a three-layer architecture:

Frontend Layer â€“ Manages GUI using Swing and WindowBuilder.
Business Layer â€“ Handles input validation and logic.
Database Layer â€“ Uses MySQL JDBC Connector for database interaction.
